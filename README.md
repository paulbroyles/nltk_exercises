# NLTK Exercises

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with the exercises from the _Natural Language Processing with Python_ book. You can make your own copy of the notebooks, run them, and complete the exercises to practice skills from the book and test your understanding.

## Getting Your Own Copy

Make sure you have Git on your computer, and create a GitHub account. While logged into your GitHub account, press the *Fork* button in the upper right of this repository to make a copy for your own account. You'll complete the exercises in your own copy.

Once you've forked the repository and are looking at the copy in your account (the page heading should say *[your user name]/nltk_exercises*), find the URL for your repository by clicking on the green *Clone or Download* button. Using whatever interface you prefer, clone your repository to your local computer. (For example, if you use git through the command line, go to the directory where you'd like the specific directory for these exercises to be created, and type `git clone https://github.com/[your user name]/nltk_exercises.git]`--this is the link you got from the Clone button.)

## Installing and Using Jupyter

Download and install Jupyter, following the directions at http://jupyter.org/install.html. Once you have successfully installed Jupyter, open the Terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned your fork of the repository and enter the *nltk_exercises* directory. Once you're inside that directory, type `jupyter notebook` to start Jupyter. A browser window should open automatically; if not, follow the instructions on the screen.

Once Jupyter launches, you'll be presented with a list of available notebooks, ending in the extension .ipynb. Select the notebook for the chapter you're on to launch it.

Inside the notebook, you'll find each of the exercises from the end of the chapter, followed by a grey box, with *In [ ]* appearing to the left. To complete an exercise, click on the box and type the code that solves the problem you've been posed. Once you've written enough code that you think you've solved the problem--or you just want to test what your code does--click the button on the toolbar that looks like a Play button. That will run the code in the cell (box) you've currently selected; any output from the code will appear directly below the box where you entered the code. If you make changes to the code, simply click the same button again to re-run it.

If an exercise requires an answer in text, rather than in code (for instance, if it's asking you to explain something), go to the selection menu that currently says Code and select Markdown instead. Here you can enter text in Markdown syntax; you can simply enter plain text, or visit https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax for documentation of Markdown. (The questions in each notebook have been entered in Markdown.)
